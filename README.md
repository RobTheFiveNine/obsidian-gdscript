## Setup (manual)
The plugin is going to be submitted to the Obsidian team to hopefully be approved as a community plugin, but for now, if you wish to install the plugin manually.

1. Navigate to the vault you wish to install it in using your file explorer
2. Navigate into the `.obisidian` directory, and in there, go into the `plugins` directory
3. Create a new folder in here named `gdscript-syntax-highlighting`
4. Head over to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/RobTheFiveNine/obsidian-gdscript/releases/latest) and download the `main.js` and `manifest.json` files into the newly created folder.
5. Open the settings window in Obsidian and enable the plugin in the `Community plugins` section
